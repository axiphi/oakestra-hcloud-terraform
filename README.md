# Oakestra Terraform Setup for Development Deployment on Hetzner Cloud

This repository contains a Terraform project for deploying a development Oakestra setup on Hetzner Cloud.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1. **Required Tools**
   * [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/)
   * [WireGuard (Tools)](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)
2. **Optional Tools** 
   * [pv](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/pv/) for progress indications 
3. **Root Privileges**
   * Your user needs to have root privileges on your local machine (e.g. via `sudo`).


## Quick Start Guide

1. **Clone this Repository**
2. **Configure Variables**:
   * Create a `.tfvars` file to customize your deployment (e.g. `oakestra.tfvars`).
3. **Initialize Terraform**:
   * `$ terraform init`
4. **Deploy the Infrastructure**:
   * `$ terraform apply -var-file="oakestra.tfvars"`
5. **Interact with the Setup**
   * see next section


## Interacting with the Setup

After deployment, Terraform will generate a Bash script at `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/oakestra-dev/<setup-name>/init.sh`
(e.g. `~/.local/share/oakestra-dev/oak/init.sh`). 
Sourcing this script (e.g. `$ . ~/.local/share/oakestra-dev/oak/init.sh`) will make a new commands
available in your shell for interacting with the Oakestra components.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't want to manually source the generated `init.sh` script everytime you start a new shell,
> you can automatically do it in your shell initialization script, for example:
> - Bash: `for oak_init in ~/.local/share/oakestra-dev/*/init.sh; do [ -e "${oak_init}" ] && . "${oak_init}"; done`
> - Zsh: `for oak_init in ~/.local/share/oakestra-dev/*/init.sh(N); do . "${oak_init}"; done`


### Commands

- **`<setup-name>-up`**:
  - Setup WireGuard tunnel to nodes deployed on Hetzner Cloud.
  - Uses `sudo` internally, will ask for your user's password.
- **`<setup-name>-down`**
  - Tears down WireGuard tunnel to nodes deployed on Hetzner Cloud.
  - Uses `sudo` internally, will ask for your user's password.
- **`<setup-name>-ssh <node-name>`**:
  - Connect to any node of the setup via SSH.
  - Naming scheme of the nodes (with indices starting at one):
    - Container Registry: `registry`   
    - Root Orchestrator: `root-orc`
    - Cluster Orchestrator C: `cluster-<C>-orc`
    - Worker W (in Cluster C): `worker-<C>-<W>`
  - Examples:
    - `$ oak-ssh root-orc`
    - `$ oak-ssh cluster-1-orc`
    - `$ oak-ssh worker-2-1`
- **`<setup-name>-image-push <image-name>`**:
  - Pushes a container image to the setup, replacing affected, running containers automatically.
  - The host/port and version parts of the image name don't matter, just the actual name has to match.
  - Examples:
    - `$ oak-image-push oakestra/oakestra-net/root-service-manager:development`
    - `$ oak-image-push ghcr.io/oakestra/oakestra-net/root-service-manager:v0.4.400`
- **`<setup-name>-nodeengine-push <node-engine-bin> <node-engined-bin>`**
  - Updates and restarts the `nodeengine` service on all worker nodes.
  - Example: `$ oak-nodeengine-push ./NodeEngine_arm64 ./nodeengined_arm64`
- **`<setup-name>-netmanager-push <net-manager-bin>`**
  - Updates and restarts the `netmanager` service on all worker nodes.
  - Example: `$ oak-netmanager-push ./arm64-NetManager`

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to run `$ <setup-name>-down` before using `$ tf destroy` or `$ tofu destroy`,
> to make sure the WireGuard tunnel is properly removed.
> If your forgot to do this, you can remove the WireGuard network interface manually with `$ sudo ip link del wg-<setup-name>`.
